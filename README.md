# Instagram Coding Question Bot

This Python script generates coding questions and posts them on Instagram every 24 hours. It uses the OpenAI API to generate questions and the Instabot library to post them on an Instagram account.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mayank-bharwal/AlgorithmArena.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd AlgorithmArena
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install openai instabot pillow
   ```

4. Set up your OpenAI API key:

   - Open the script (`instagram_coding_bot.py`) and replace `'your_openai_api_key_here'` with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. Create a custom font file:

   - If you have a custom font for the text in the image, save it as `Lemon-Regular.ttf` in the project directory. If not, the script will use the default font.

6. Create a logo file (optional):

   - If you want to add a logo to the images, save the logo image as `logo.png` in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python instagram_coding_bot.py

   ```

   This will start the bot, which will generate coding questions and post them on Instagram at regular intervals.

2. To customize the bot's behavior, you can edit the script and modify parameters such as the Instagram account credentials, posting frequency, and more.
